## The c++ Memory Model

### The Atomic Operations

■ Store operations, which can have memory_order_relaxed, memory_order_release,
or memory_order_seq_cst ordering
■ Load operations, which can have memory_order_relaxed, memory_order_consume,
memory_order_acquire, or memory_order_seq_cst ordering
■ Read-modify-write operations, which can have memory_order_relaxed, memory_
order_consume, memory_order_acquire, memory_order_release, memory_order_
acq_rel, or memory_order_seq_cst ordering

### Memory Orderings

#### memory_order_seq_cst
#### memory_order_relaxed,
#### memory_order_consume,
#### memory_order_acquire,
#### memory_order_release,
#### memory_order_acq_rel,
